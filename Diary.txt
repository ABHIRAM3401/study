Day 1 : 23-04-2005
    started learning about open cv in yt channel https://youtu.be/eDIj5LuIL4A?si=aqz3QyjUPCYaw_5z

    made some manipulations in imread() function
    USE OF RESIZE:
        First I got a problem , the window or frame size is too large , because of that i cannot visualize the entire image .
        So i have changed the image size by using the "cv2.resize(img,(widht,height))" function , later i have tried different sizes 
        to visualize that image . As it is a square image of size 1024 , i have changed its size to 800

        CUSTOMIZED WINDOW CREATION:
        my question to gpt : so the first paramter of imshow is not just a random name of the window ,we can create multile named windows and we can use those different windows based on our requirement
        the ans by gpt: Exactly! ðŸ’¡ You nailed it.

        https://chatgpt.com/c/6808e059-2914-8003-89e8-50b674a92a88   https://chatgpt.com/share/6808e92b-9978-8003-ae9f-c85a1e6c3930

        surprise , chat gpt has given me some other code for the above problem and that made me to dive deeper into naming windows and 
        the actual purpose of the first paramter of imshow('window_name',flag) and different flags in cv2.namedWindow().

            cv2.namedWindow('My Window', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
            cv2.resizeWindow('My Window', 800, 600)
            cv2.imshow('My Window', img)

        by using the cv2.namedWindow() fucntion we can create a customized window with the below features with the help of different flags
        here we can create multiple windows of different flags based on our purpose.
        Flag	            Description
        cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL	Allows the user to resize the window.
        cv2.WINDOW_AUTOSIZE	Default. Window size matches image size, and you cannot resize it.
        cv2.WINDOW_FULLSCREEN	Displays window in fullscreen mode (depends on OS support).
        cv2.WINDOW_FREERATIO	Allows resizing the image freely without keeping aspect ratio.
        cv2.WINDOW_KEEPRATIO	Resizes image but keeps aspect ratio. Usually used with resizeWindow().
        
        we can adust the size of the window by using the cv2.resizeWindow('window_name',width,height)
        THIS ALL STARTED BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE PROBLEM and that made to learn some intresting things.

        LATER TRIED NORMAL AND KEEPRATIO FLAGS
        if we just create a window and if we are not using it for displaying any image , then an empty window is displayed on the screen
            cv2.imshow('actual',img)
            cv2.waitKey(3000)
            cv2.namedWindow('Normal window', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
            cv2.resizeWindow('Normal window', 800, 300)

            cv2.namedWindow('Keepratio',cv2.WINDOW_KEEPRATIO)
            cv2.resizeWindow('Keepratio',400,550)

            cv2.imshow('Normal window', img)
            cv2.waitKey(3000)
            # cv2.imshow('keepratio', img)
            # cv2.waitKey(0)
            cv2.destroyAllWindows()

            in this code , i have commented the code for imshow('keepratio') so the image doesn't dsplayed but as i have created the window , 
            it displays an empty window on my screen ,
            sorry to say this but , even if i use an image to show with that window an extra empty window is displaying , i need to check about that later

    Video reading :
        "cv2.VideoCapture" This is a class in OpenCV used to handle video streams â€” from a file, a webcam, or even a network stream.
        OpenCV attempts to open the video file located at that path.
        If successful, it creates a VideoCapture object which acts like a "video reader."
        This object lets you read the video one frame at a time using .read().

        what does videoCapture returns  i.e. what will be stored in the video variable?
            video will store a cv2.VideoCapture object, which is basically a handler (or interface) that OpenCV uses to interact with the video.
            print(type(video)) --> <class 'cv2.VideoCapture'>

        ret, frame = video.read()    
            ret is the return status â€” like saying "Did this operation succeed? 
            frame is the actual data returned.

        ðŸ”“ What does .release() do?
            It releases the resources associated with the cv2.VideoCapture object.
            This means:
            If it's a video file, OpenCV closes the file.If it's a webcam or external camera, OpenCV releases the hardware (so other apps can use it).
            Prevents memory leaks, resource locks, and weird behavior if you open multiple streams.

        ðŸ§½ Why it's important:
            If you donâ€™t call .release():
            Your program might keep the file open.
            You might lock your webcam, and other apps (like Zoom) won't be able to use it.
            Over time, it can lead to resource exhaustion if you're working with many video streams.
        ðŸ§  Think of it like:
            If cv2.VideoCapture is you checking out a book, then release() is returning the book to the library once youâ€™re done.

    Return value of waitKey():
        "
        cv2.imshow('image',resized)
        b = cv2.waitKey(5000) 
        print(b)
        what will be the output of that and what does cv2.waitKey() returns
        
        "
        If you press a key during those 5 seconds, cv2.waitKey(5000) will return the ASCII code of the key you pressed.
        If no key is pressed during the 5 seconds, cv2.waitKey(5000) will return -1.

        " and when press any key why the window is closing rather than waiting for 5 seconds"
        Ah, great observation! Here's the catch:
        In OpenCV, the behavior of cv2.waitKey() is a little subtle . cv2.waitKey(delay) waits up to delay milliseconds for a key press.
        If you press a key before the delay finishes, cv2.waitKey() immediately returns, and the program continues â€” it doesn't continue waiting after a key is pressed.
        âœ… If no key is pressed, it will wait full 5 seconds.
        âœ… If any key is pressed, it stops waiting immediately.


        " or we can select any particular key wiht 0xFF ord('q')what about this"
        Exactly, you're thinking in the right direction! ðŸ”¥ Letâ€™s explain it properly:
        cv2.waitKey(0) waits forever for any key. & 0xFF ensures you get a clean 8-bit keycode.
        ord('q') gives you the numeric code for 'q'. Then you can do things depending on which key the user pressed!

        If you don't press anything during 5 seconds, cv2.waitKey(5000) returns -1 (after masking with & 0xFF, it becomes 255 â€” small technical detail Iâ€™ll explain below).
    USE OF WEBCAM :
        Instead of giving the video path for the videoCapture if we give input as a digit (generally 0 as our main webcam) it activates the webcam and we can get frames from it . here we dont need the ret vlaue because (find the reason in code of webcam ) .


            TRYING TO CONNECT MY MOBILE CAM TO LAPTOP BUT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE WIHTOUT A DEDICATED DRIVER OR SOFTWARE BECAUSE WE CONNECT OUR 
            MOBILE TO LAPTOP IN ANY OF THESE 3 MODES 1.  CHARGING ONLY , 2 .  Media/Files Transfer Protocol (MTP) , 3  .Picture Transfer 
            Protocol (PTP)  AND ANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MY MOBILE CAMERA

                Different Protocols: Standard webcams communicate using specific video protocols that operating systems readily understand. Mobile phone cameras, when connected via USB, typically operate in different modes like Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) for file transfer or Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) for photo access. These protocols don't inherently provide a live video stream in the format expected by webcam applications.

                Driver Requirements: Webcams have specific drivers that allow the operating system and applications to interact with their video and control functionalities. When you connect a phone via USB in MTP/PTP mode, it usually uses generic drivers for file access, not the specialized drivers needed for live video streaming as a webcam. Â  

                Virtualization Layer: Software like DroidCam acts as a crucial intermediary. It captures the video stream from your phone's camera and then creates a virtual webcam device on your computer. This virtual device adheres to the standard webcam protocols and has its own drivers, allowing applications like your OpenCV script or meeting software to recognize and use it.
