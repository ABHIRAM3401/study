    made some manipulations in imread() function
    USE OF RESIZE:
        First I got a problem , the window or frame size is too large , because of that i cannot visualize the entire image .
        So i have changed the image size by using the "cv2.resize(img,(widht,height))" function , later that i have tried different sizes 
        to visualize that image , its good to have that fucntion. As it is a square image of size 1024 , i have changed its size to 800
