Day 1 : 23-04-2005
    started learning about open cv in yt channel https://youtu.be/eDIj5LuIL4A?si=aqz3QyjUPCYaw_5z

    made some manipulations in imread() function
    USE OF RESIZE:
        First I got a problem , the window or frame size is too large , because of that i cannot visualize the entire image .
        So i have changed the image size by using the "cv2.resize(img,(widht,height))" function , later i have tried different sizes 
        to visualize that image . As it is a square image of size 1024 , i have changed its size to 800

        CUSTOMIZED WINDOW CREATION:
        my question to gpt : so the first paramter of imshow is not just a random name of the window ,we can create multile named windows and we can use those different windows based on our requirement
        the ans by gpt: Exactly! ðŸ’¡ You nailed it.

        surprise , chat gpt has given me some other code for the above problem and that made me to dive deeper into naming windows and 
        the actual purpose of the first paramter of imshow('window_name',flag) and different flags in cv2.namedWindow().

            cv2.namedWindow('My Window', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
            cv2.resizeWindow('My Window', 800, 600)
            cv2.imshow('My Window', img)

        by using the cv2.namedWindow() fucntion we can create a customized window with the below features with the help of different flags
        here we can create multiple windows of different flags based on our purpose.
        Flag	            Description
        cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL	Allows the user to resize the window.
        cv2.WINDOW_AUTOSIZE	Default. Window size matches image size, and you cannot resize it.
        cv2.WINDOW_FULLSCREEN	Displays window in fullscreen mode (depends on OS support).
        cv2.WINDOW_FREERATIO	Allows resizing the image freely without keeping aspect ratio.
        cv2.WINDOW_KEEPRATIO	Resizes image but keeps aspect ratio. Usually used with resizeWindow().
        
        we can adust the size of the window by using the cv2.resizeWindow('window_name',width,height)
        THIS ALL STARTED BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE PROBLEM and that made to learn some intresting things.

        LATER TRIED NORMAL AND KEEPRATIO FLAGS
        if we just create a window and if we are not using it for displaying any image , then an empty window is displayed on the screen
            cv2.imshow('actual',img)
            cv2.waitKey(3000)
            cv2.namedWindow('Normal window', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
            cv2.resizeWindow('Normal window', 800, 300)

            cv2.namedWindow('Keepratio',cv2.WINDOW_KEEPRATIO)
            cv2.resizeWindow('Keepratio',400,550)

            cv2.imshow('Normal window', img)
            cv2.waitKey(3000)
            # cv2.imshow('keepratio', img)
            # cv2.waitKey(0)
            cv2.destroyAllWindows()

            in this code , i have commented the code for imshow('keepratio') so the image doesn't dsplayed but as i have created the window , 
            it displays an empty window on my screen ,
            sorry to say this but , even if i use an image to show with that window an extra empty window is displaying , i need to check about that later
